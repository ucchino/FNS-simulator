First, to obtain matlab compliant files as simulation output of FNS, use the switch '-m' in the experiment command, as explained on the user manual.
Then, rename the output files of the simulation as 'burning_matlab.csv' and 'firing_matlab.csv', and locate them in the matlab current folder.
Finally, 
- run the script 'FNS_spiking.m' to obtain the rasterplot and the related time series of the spiking activity produced by the simulated nodes (brain regions);
- run the script 'FNS_postsynaptic.m' to obtain the time series of the local field potential evoked at the specified nodes (brain regions).
